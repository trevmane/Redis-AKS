# Redis-AKS
Create Redis Cluster(s) and Database(s) running on AKS
Throughout this repo you will find instructions on how to:
1) Create 2 AKS clusters to be used for Redis
2) Deploy Redis Enterprise Operator on each of these clusters
3) Deploy local Redis Enterprise Cluster (REC) and locally HA Redis Enterprise Database (REDB)
4) Create and configure an Ingress Controller to enable connectivity from outside of the AKS cluster
5) Deploy Redis Enterprise Remote Cluster (RERC) and Redis Enterprise Active Active Databse (REAADB) across the 2 clusters
